🎮 Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple and interactive Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows a user to play against the computer with real-time score tracking and instant feedback.

🧠 Project Overview

This project recreates the classic Rock Paper Scissors game in a web-based format. The player selects one of the three options, and the computer randomly chooses its move. The winner is determined based on standard game rules, and scores are updated dynamically.
